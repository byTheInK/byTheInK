# 🧑🏻‍💻 $(whoami)
I am a *young* developer trying to make internet a better place. I am programming since when I was 7 years old. I was playing games until I said “Why wouldn't I make my own game?”. I started with Lua, I tried Roblox Studio  and LÖVE. They felt good but not enough so I tried Python. I didn't know how to learn it so I switched back to Lua. Fast forward, now I am here. Fighting for my *career*.
